Q: I am testing a self-written julia package. I have a plotting function. Is there any way to test if there is meaningful output? or can I only test if it doesn't throw an error?
A: Of course! This is an excellent question and a crucial part of building a robust package. You can absolutely test for more than just the absence of an error.

There are two primary, powerful methods to test your plotting functions for "meaningful output":

1.  **Testing the Plot Object:** Inspect the data and attributes of the generated plot object itself. This is fast, robust, and independent of the final rendered image.
2.  **Visual Regression Testing:** Compare the rendered image of your plot against a pre-saved "reference" image. This ensures the visual output is *exactly* what you expect.

Let's break down how to do each.

---

### Setup

First, ensure your `Project.toml` is set up for testing. If you created your package with `PkgTemplates.jl`, you'll have a `/test` directory with a `runtests.jl` file.

In your `[extras]` section of `Project.toml`, you should have `Test`. For these examples, we'll also use `Plots`. For visual regression, we'll add `ReferenceTests` and `FileIO`.

```toml
# MyPackage/Project.toml

[extras]
Plots = "91a5bcdd-55d7-5caf-9e0b-520d859cae80"
ReferenceTests = "2b220914-2975-4161-97b7-573523456383"
Test = "8dfed614-e22c-5e08-85e1-65c5234f0b40"
FileIO = "5789e2e9-d7fb-5bc7-8068-2c6fae9b9549" # Needed by ReferenceTests

[targets]
test = ["Test", "Plots", "ReferenceTests", "FileIO"]
```

Then in your package's environment, run: `pkg> test` to make sure these are installed for the test environment.

---

### Method 1: Testing the Plot Object (Recommended for Data Integrity)

This is the most common and often the most useful approach. Most plotting libraries (`Plots.jl`, `Makie.jl`, etc.) create a structured object that contains all the data and metadata for the plot before it's rendered. You can test the contents of this object.

Let's assume your function in `src/MyPackage.jl` looks something like this:

```julia
# src/MyPackage.jl
module MyPackage

using Plots

export create_my_plot

function create_my_plot(x, y; title_str="Default Title")
    plot(x, y,
        label="My Data",
        xlabel="Time",
        ylabel="Value",
        title=title_str,
        seriestype=:scatter
    )
end

end
```

Now, your test file `test/runtests.jl` can inspect the plot object returned by this function.

```julia
# test/runtests.jl
using MyPackage
using Test
using Plots # We need this to understand the plot object

@testset "MyPackage.jl Plotting Tests" begin
    @testset "create_my_plot object inspection" begin
        x_data = 1:5
        y_data = [2, 3, 5, 4, 7]
        custom_title = "My Test Plot"

        # 1. Just test that it runs without error (the basic test)
        # This is a good first step. @test_nowarn is great for this.
        @test_nowarn create_my_plot(x_data, y_data)

        # 2. Generate the plot object to inspect it
        p = create_my_plot(x_data, y_data, title_str=custom_title)

        # 3. Test for meaningful output by inspecting the object's fields
        @test p isa Plots.Plot # Is it a plot object?

        # Test plot-level attributes
        @test p.attr[:title] == custom_title
        @test p.attr[:xaxis].attr[:label] == "Time"
        @test p.attr[:yaxis].attr[:label] == "Value"

        # Test the data series itself
        # Plots.jl stores series in a list. We check the first one.
        @test length(p.series_list) == 1
        series = p.series_list[1]

        @test series[:x] == x_data
        @test series[:y] == y_data
        @test series[:label] == "My Data"
        @test series[:seriestype] == :scatter
    end
end
```

**Pros:**
*   **Fast:** No rendering or file I/O is required.
*   **Robust:** Not affected by minor changes in rendering libraries, fonts, or operating systems.
*   **Clear Failures:** If the data is wrong, `_test series[:x] == [1, 2, 3]` will fail with a very clear message.

**Cons:**
*   Doesn't test the final visual appearance (e.g., if a color scheme change makes text unreadable).

---

### Method 2: Visual Regression Testing (Recommended for Visual Consistency)

This method is the gold standard for ensuring your plot's *look and feel* doesn't change unexpectedly. The package `ReferenceTests.jl` is perfect for this.

The workflow is:
1.  Run the test for the first time. It will fail because no "reference" image exists, and it will create one for you.
2.  Manually inspect the newly created image. If it looks correct, commit it to your repository.
3.  On all subsequent test runs, `ReferenceTests.jl` will generate a new image and compare it to the reference image. The test passes if they are identical (or very similar).

Here's how to set it up. It's good practice to put reference images in a subdirectory.

```julia
# test/runtests.jl
using MyPackage
using Test
using Plots
using ReferenceTests
using FileIO # Required by ReferenceTests to save the plot

# Create a directory for reference images if it doesn't exist
# This is good practice to keep your test directory clean
ref_img_dir = joinpath(@__DIR__, "refimages")
!isdir(ref_img_dir) && mkdir(ref_img_dir)

@testset "MyPackage.jl Visual Regression Tests" begin
    @testset "create_my_plot visual test" begin
        x_data = 1:5
        y_data = [2, 3, 5, 4, 7]

        # Generate the plot
        p = create_my_plot(x_data, y_data, title_str="Visual Test")

        # The core of the test
        # The first time this runs, it will save the plot to the specified path.
        # On subsequent runs, it will compare the new plot to that saved file.
        @test_reference joinpath(ref_img_dir, "scatter_plot.png") p
    end
end
```

#### How to Manage Reference Images

*   **First Run:** When you run `pkg> test`, this test will fail with a message like `Reference file ... not found. Storing current result.`. It will create `test/refimages/scatter_plot.png`. You should open this file, check that it looks correct, and then `git add test/refimages/scatter_plot.png` and commit it.
*   **Updating a Plot:** If you intentionally change your plot's appearance and want to update the reference image, you can run your tests with a special environment variable:
    ```bash
    $ JULIA_REVISE_TESTS=true julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
    ```
    This will cause `ReferenceTests.jl` to overwrite the old reference images with the new output. Again, you should inspect the changes and commit them.

**Pros:**
*   **Comprehensive:** Catches *any* visual change, including data, colors, fonts, layout, markers, etc.
*   **Definitive:** It's the ultimate test for "does it look right?".

**Cons:**
*   **Brittle:** Minor, unimportant rendering differences between different library versions or operating systems can cause tests to fail.
*   **Maintenance:** Requires storing binary image files in your repository and has a manual update process.
*   **Large Files:** If you have many plots, the reference images can bloat your repository size (consider using Git LFS).

### Summary and Best Practice

For a robust testing suite, **use a combination of both methods**:

1.  **Use Object Inspection** for the majority of your tests. Verify that the correct data is being passed to the plotting backend, that labels are set, and that series types are correct. These tests are fast and stable.
2.  **Use Visual Regression Testing** for a small number of key, representative plots. This gives you a high-level guarantee that the overall visual style hasn't been broken by a dependency update or a code change.

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: fast, detailed data checks and a safety net for the final visual product.

Q: To test my shibbs implementation i have a sinewave and a squarewave mixed together. The shibbs algorithm however needs to run multiple times on itâ€™s own output to recover the original waves. I read, that shibbs can run into local minima. Is that correct?

A: The SHIBBS (Separation of Harmonic Interference Using Basis Based Methods) algorithm, like many optimization-based signal separation techniques, can indeed encounter issues with local minima. This is a common challenge in iterative optimization algorithms where the solution space is complex and has multiple minima.

Here's a brief explanation of why local minima can be a problem:

Optimization Landscape: In many optimization problems, the cost or objective function that the algorithm is trying to minimize may have multiple "valleys" or minima. The global minimum represents the best solution, but there can be many local minima where the cost function is lower than at nearby points but not the lowest overall.

Iterative Nature: Algorithms like SHIBBS often work iteratively, adjusting parameters to gradually improve the solution. Depending on the initial conditions and the nature of the optimization landscape, the algorithm might converge to a local minimum rather than the global minimum.

Initial Conditions: The starting point for the iterations can significantly influence whether the algorithm converges to a global or local minimum. Poor initial conditions might lead the algorithm into a local minimum from which it cannot escape.

Algorithm Design: Some algorithms include features to try to avoid local minima, such as random restarts, simulated annealing, or other techniques to explore the solution space more broadly.

In the context of SHIBBS, if the algorithm gets stuck in a local minimum, it might not perfectly separate the sine wave and the square wave, especially if they have overlapping harmonics or other complexities. Running the algorithm multiple times with different initial conditions or tweaking the algorithm parameters might help in achieving better separation by avoiding local minima.
